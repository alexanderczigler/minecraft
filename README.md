Run a Minecraft server easily with Docker.

## Running

### Minecraft server

There are currently three versions of the minecraft/server image being maintained. They are using Minecraft versions 1.12.2, 1.13.2 and 1.14.2 respectively. Use the appropriate tag when running your server. **NOTE:** strange things can happen if you run an older server using realm data generated by a newer version.

- registry.gitlab.com/alexanderczigler/minecraft/server:1.12
- registry.gitlab.com/alexanderczigler/minecraft/server:1.13
- registry.gitlab.com/alexanderczigler/minecraft/server:1.14

#### Docker standalone

```bash
docker run -p 25565:25565 -p 25575:25575 registry.gitlab.com/alexanderczigler/minecraft/server:1.14
```

#### Docker Swarm

Put the following into *minecraft.yml*
```yml
version: '3.4'

services:
  server:
    image: registry.gitlab.com/alexanderczigler/minecraft/server:1.14
    networks:
      - default
    ports:
      - 25565:25565 # Server
      - 25575:25575 # RCON
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
```

Deploy by running `docker stack deploy minecraft --compose-file minecraft.yml`

### Minecraft Overviewer

I also have a docker image prepared with Minecraft Overviewer. You can use this to generate a beautiful map of your server (versions up to 1.12.2 only).

### Minecraft chat + Discord

Have your minecraft server's chat log sent to a Discord channel in near real-time.
